Sometimes you have medicines in your house, and you don't remember what they are for or which ones have expired. This app helps you organize your meds and tries to guide you on how to use things you don't need because it might help other people.

#### Things we have learned

## Description

This application uses authentication with credentials and Google, we have created the login page and the registration page, for users to register and have control of the medicines in their house, to do this, you must create a house or join to one This is because you can organize your medicines with the people in your house and have more control over them, when you create a house your kit is empty and you can add more medicines with a simple button, when you want to join an existing house you will have to tell one of existing house members who share a simple QR code with you and use the "Join a house" button to open your camera and then scan this code to join.

Then you have a house that you can add new drugs to and can be viewed and edited by all members of the house, and deleted with a simple dismiss, the forms in my apps have validation because we need specific information to help improve your organization. You have to give us the form to add medicine: Name, dose, units, quantity, expiration date and active ingredients.

This app will have a side menu with all the settings and information you need to organize your medicines and first-aid kits in the best way at home
